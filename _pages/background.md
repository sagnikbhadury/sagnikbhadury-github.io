# My Sanctuary

I am passionate about the harmonious world of melodies, my musical tastes are eclectic, yet I possess a particular fondness for Classical Music, spanning from the rich traditions of Hindusthani to the timeless compositions of European origin. Literature has been a constant companion in my journey; I have indulged in numerous Bengali and English novels, which fueled my once insatiable appetite for reading. Photography is another avenue of artistic expression I explore intermittently; while a Google Pixel often suffices for casual endeavors, I turn to my <span style ="color:red">[Sony 7 Alpha II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_%CE%B17)</span>, coupled with a <span style ="color:red">[Nikon 70-300mm VR lens](https://downloadcenter.nikonimglib.com/en/products/287/AF-S_VR_Zoom-Nikkor_70-300mm_f_45-56G_IF-ED.html)</span> through a Viltrox adapter, for more serious photographic pursuits. Lastly, hiking is fun!
