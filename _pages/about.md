I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow**  in the <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span> ,  <span style = "color:blue">[Michigan Medicine](https://www.uofmhealth.org/)</span>, <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/)</span>, being mentored by <span style ="color:blue">[Arvind Rao, PhD](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/rao-arvind.html)</span>.

My research, from a Bayesian perspective, has focused on Directed and Undirected Graphs, High-Dimensional Graphical Models, Sparse Network Estimation, and Hierarchical Models. I have been increasingly drawn to Spatial Statistics, Variational Bayes Algorithms, and Computational Statistics, within the field of Biostatistics. On the application side, my focus lies in Gene Networks, Cancer Biology, Genomics, Single Cell Seq Data, Spatial Transcriptomics, and Image Informatics.

I earned _Ph.D._ in _Biostatistics_ under the watchful eye of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span>, from <span style ="color:blue">[University of Louisville; Louisville, KY, USA](https://louisville.edu/)</span> in Fall 2022. My work was focused on method development for high-dimensional Bayesian graphical estimation and heterogeneous joint network estimation, and applying these methods to multiple breast cancer applications. Prior to my graduation, I won the Doctoral Dissertation Completion Award from the Graduate School of University of Louisville.
