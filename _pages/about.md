I am 4<sup>th</sup> year PhD student in _Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics_ at [Penn State College of Medicine](https://med.psu.edu/). As my thesis research, I am trying to develop a coherent framework to study the underlying issues of using Bayes Factor for testing of hypotheses and using these insights for Bayesian model selection in standard (linear) and non-standard (Cox PH survival) regressions. Before joining Penn State, I completed _B.Sc. (Bachelor of Science)_ in Statistics from [St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, India](http://www.sxccal.edu/) and _M.Stat. (Masters of Statistics)_ from [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/).

I actively participate in multiple interdisciplinary research. Some of my major collaborative projects include

1. Tobacco addiction research and its impact on tobacco regulatory sciences ([Penn State Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science](https://sites.psu.edu/tcors/)).

2. Application of Machine Learning techniques in medical disgnostics and prediction among children with Sickle Cell Disease and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (with [Pritish Mondal](https://childrens.pennstatehealth.org/display-provider/-/provider/1923/pritish-mondal-md))

3. Cross cultural pattern of emotion perception in music and how musical features (like rhythm) affects it (with [Nandini Chatterjee Singh](http://nandinisingh.wixsite.com/labweb))

4. Investigation of Factors affecting the survival differences in Glioblastoma based on data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas Program
](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) (with [Darya (Dasha) Nesterova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darya-dasha-nesterova-a11876b3/))

5. Screening and assessment tool for dyslexia in regional Indian languages ([DALI](http://14.139.62.22/DALI/index.php))



Outside studies, I enjoy volleyball, cooking and [adda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adda_(South_Asian))
