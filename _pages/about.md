I am currently working as a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow**  of <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/)</span>, working with <span style ="color:blue">[Arvind Rao, PhD](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/rao-arvind.html)</span> in the <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span>. 

My research focusses on Undirected Graphs, High Dimensional Bayesian Graphical Models, Bayesian Hierarchical Models, Shrinkage Priors, Bayesian Variable Selection, Spatial Statistics. Apart from these I am interested in Variational Bayes Algorithms, Computational Statistics, Longitudinal Data Analysis abutting on areas of Biostatistics. From an application perspective I am interested in Gene networks, Cancer Biology, Single Cell Seq Data, Spatial Transcriptomics and Image Informatics. I have also worked previously with Pediatric MEDICAID data. 

I received PhD in Biostatistics in Fall 2022, under the supervision of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span>, where we obtained Gene Networks for multiple Breast Cancer types. I won the UofL Graduate School Dissertation Completion Award. During my graduate studies, I collaborated with <span style ="color:blue">[Department of Radiation Oncology](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/radiationoncology)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Department of Pediatrics](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/pediatrics)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Kentucky Antibiotic Awareness](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/pediatrics/research/cahrds/KYAbxAwareness)</span>.
