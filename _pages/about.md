I am 4<sup>th</sup> year PhD student in **Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics** at [Penn State College of Medicine](https://med.psu.edu/). With [Dr. Jason Liao](https://sites.google.com/site/jiangangliao/) and [Dr. Arthur Berg](http://www.personal.psu.edu/asb17/Homepage/Welcome.html) I am developing a coherent framework to study the trials and tribulations
 of using Bayes Factor and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) in testing of hypotheses and model selection. 
 
Before joining Penn State, I completed _B.Sc. (Bachelor of Science)_ in Statistics from [St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, India](http://www.sxccal.edu/) and _M.Stat. (Masters of Statistics)_ from [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/).

I actively participate in multiple interdisciplinary research. Some of my major collaborative projects include

* Conduct research on Tobacco addiction behavior and its impact on policy and the regulation of tobacco products ([Penn State Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science](https://sites.psu.edu/tcors/)).

* Application of Machine Learning techniques in medical disgnostics and prediction among children with Sickle Cell Disease and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (with [Pritish Mondal, MD](https://childrens.pennstatehealth.org/display-provider/-/provider/1923/pritish-mondal-md))

* Cross cultural pattern of emotion perception in music (with [Dr. Nandini Chatterjee Singh](http://nandinisingh.wixsite.com/labweb))

* Investigation of factors affecting the survival differences in Glioblastoma based on data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas Program
](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) (with [Darya (Dasha) Nesterova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darya-dasha-nesterova-a11876b3/))

* Development of first ever Screening and Assessment tool for Dyslexia in regional Indian languages ([DALI](http://14.139.62.22/DALI/index.php))
