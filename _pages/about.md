<span style="text-align: justify"> I am 4<sup>th</sup> year PhD student in **Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics** at [Penn State College of Medicine](https://med.psu.edu/). With [Jason Liao, PhD](https://sites.google.com/site/jiangangliao/) and [Arthur Berg, PhD](http://www.personal.psu.edu/asb17/Homepage/Welcome.html), I am developing a coherent framework to study the trials and tribulations
 of using Bayes Factor and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) in testing of hypotheses and model selection.</span> 
 
<span style="text-align: justify"> Before joining Penn State, I completed _B.Sc. (Bachelor of Science)_ in Statistics from [St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, India](http://www.sxccal.edu/) and _M.Stat. (Masters of Statistics)_ from [Indian Statistical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/).</span>

I actively participate in multiple interdisciplinary research. Some of my major collaborative projects include

* Research on Tobacco addictive behavior - its impact on policy and the regulation of tobacco products ([Penn State Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science](https://sites.psu.edu/tcors/)).

* Application of Machine Learning techniques in medical disgnostics and prediction of pulmonary fucntions among children with Sickle Cell Disease and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (with [Pritish Mondal, MD](https://childrens.pennstatehealth.org/display-provider/-/provider/1923/pritish-mondal-md))

* Investigation of cross-cultural pattern of emotion perception in music (with [Nandini Chatterjee Singh, PhD](http://nandinisingh.wixsite.com/labweb))

* Exploration of factors affecting the survival differences in Glioblastoma (with [Darya (Dasha) Nesterova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darya-dasha-nesterova-a11876b3/))

I was part of the team that developed the first ever Screening and Assessment tool for Dyslexia in regional Indian languages ([DALI](http://14.139.62.22/DALI/index.php)). Codes for some of my papers and projects can be found in my [github profile](https://github.com/vishalmidya). 

I am a serious Matcha green tea aficionado. Outside studies, I enjoy rowing, volleyball, cooking and [adda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adda_(South_Asian)).
