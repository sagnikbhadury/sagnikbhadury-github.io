I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow**  in the <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span> ,  <span style = "color:blue">[Michigan Medicine](https://www.uofmhealth.org/)</span>, <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/)</span>, being mentored by <span style ="color:blue">[Arvind Rao, PhD](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/rao-arvind.html)</span>.

My research portfolio is anchored in a Bayesian framework, addressing theoretical constructs like Directed and Undirected Graphs, High-Dimensional Graphical Models, as well as practical methodologies for Sparse Network Estimation and Bayesian Variable Selection within Hierarchical Models. Recently, I've broadened my expertise by venturing into the realms of Spatial Statistics, with particular interest in innovating through Variational Bayes Algorithms, and advancing the fields of Computational Statistics and Functional Data Analysis.

Application wise, I focus on advanced biostatistical methods for cancer research through integrative imaging statistics for gene network analysis, single-cell sequencing, Spatial Transcriptomics, and Spatial Multiplex-Immunoprofiling. My current aim is to develop methods and analytical tools for Spatial Cancer Systems Biology, leveraging on ST and mIF technologies unravelling regulatory networks in tumor microenvironments (TME), aiding Precision Medicine. Additionally, complementing these biostatistics-bioinformatics endeavors, I also apply my skills in building methods, enhancing the interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data.

I earned _Ph.D._ in _Biostatistics_ under the watchful eye of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span>, from <span style ="color:blue">[University of Louisville; Louisville, KY, USA](https://louisville.edu/)</span> in Fall 2022. I developed methods for estimating high-dimensional sparse Bayesian graphical models and heterogeneous joint networks, which I then applied to analyze multiple cancer datasets. This work formed the core of my research prior to graduation. In recognition of my doctoral research progress, the Graduate School of the University of Louisville honored me with the Doctoral Dissertation Completion Award.
