I am currently a **Rackham Postdoctoral Research Fellow**  of <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan Medical School](https://medicine.umich.edu/)</span>, affiliated to the <span style = "color:blue">[_Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics_](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics)</span> working with <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span>. 
 
I got my PhD in Biostatistics from the _Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics_ of <span style = "color:blue">[School of Public Health, University of Louisville (UofL)](https://louisville.edu/sphis)</span>. My PhD research was pursued under the supervision of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span> & primarily focused on Higher Dimensional-Bayesian-Graphical Models, Undirected Graphs, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, Bayesian Hierarchical Models, Shrinkage Priors, Bayesian Variable Selection, and High Dimensional Covariance Estimation. Apart from these I am interested in Computational Statistics, Queuing Theory and Longitudinal Data Analysis. 
  
During my PhD I worked as an RA on multiple projects in collaboration with different departments of the <span style ="color:blue">[School of Medicine, UofL](https://louisville.edu/medicine)</span> collaborating with <span style ="color:blue">[Department of Radiation Oncology, UofL](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/radiationoncology)</span>,  <span style ="color:blue">[Department of Pediatrics, UofL](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/pediatrics)</span>. I also collaborated with <span style ="color:blue">[Kentucky Antibiotic Awareness](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/pediatrics/research/cahrds/KYAbxAwareness)</span>. I won the Graduate School Dissertation Completion Award in Aug 2022 and finished as a Graduate School Fellow of UofL.
