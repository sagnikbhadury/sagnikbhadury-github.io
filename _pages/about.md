I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow**  in the <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span> of <span style = "color:blue">[Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics)</span>,  <span style = "color:blue">[Michigan Medicine](https://www.uofmhealth.org/)</span>, <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/)</span>, being mentored by <span style ="color:blue">[Arvind Rao, PhD](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/rao-arvind.html)</span>. 

My research has been centered around Undirected Graphs, High Dimensional Bayesian Graphical Models, Sparse Network Estimation, Hierarchical Models, Shrinkage Priors, Spatial Statistics. Apart from these I am interested in Variational Bayes Algorithms, Computational Statistics, Longitudinal Data Analysis abutting on areas of Biostatistics. From an application perspective, I am currently interested in Gene Networks, Cancer Biology, Single Cell Seq Data, Spatial Transcriptomics and Image Informatics.

I earned _Ph.D._ in _Biostatistics_ from <span style ="color:blue">[University of Louisville; Louisville, KY, USA](https://louisville.edu/)</span> in Fall 2022, under the supervision of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span>, was focussed on high dimensional gene network estimation for multiple breast cancers. Prior to my graduation, I won the Doctoral Dissertation Completion Award, Graduate School, University of Louisville [<span style ="color:blue">[Link](https://louisville.edu/graduate/faculty-staff/directors-of-graduate-studies/fall-2018/DoctoralDissertationCompletion.pdf/)</span>].
