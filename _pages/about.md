I am 3<sup>rd</sup> year PhD student in _Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics_ at **Penn State College of Medicine**. As my thesis research, I am trying to develope a cohorent framework to study the underlying issues of using Bayes Factor for testing of hypotheses and using these insights for Bayesian model selection in standard (linear) and non-standard (Cox PH survival) regressions. Before joining Penn State, I completed _B.Sc. (Bachelor of Science)_ in Statistics from **St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, India** and _M.Stat. (Masters of Statistics)_ from **Indian Statistical Institute**.
