I am currently a **Graduate School Fellow** of <span style = "color:blue">[University of Louisville](https://louisville.edu/sphis)</span>, in the 4th year of my PhD in Biostatistics at the _Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics_ of <span style = "color:blue">[School of Public Health, University of Louisville](https://louisville.edu/sphis)</span>.

As a PhD candidate, I am working under the supervision of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span>. My research primarily focuses on Bayesian Graphical Models in Higher Dimensions, Bayesian Variable Selection, Shrinkage Priors and High Dimensional Covariance Estimation. I am interested in addressing application oriented Statistical problems, specifically in the field of Genomics, Neuroimaging and Public Health. 

I have around 4 years of experience as a research assistant on multiple projects in collaboration with different departments of the <span style ="color:blue">[School of Medicine, UofL](https://louisville.edu/medicine)</span>. From Fall 2018 - Summer 2020, apart from TA duties, I worked on a project with <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> collaborating with <span style ="color:blue">[Department of Radiation Oncology, UofL](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/radiationoncology)</span>.  From 2020 Fall - 2022 Summer, I worked as an RA for the <span style ="color:blue">[Department of Pediatrics, UofL](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/pediatrics)</span>. During this appointment I worked with <span style ="color:blue">[Maiying Kong, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/maiying-kong-phd)</span>, <span style ="color:blue">[Scott Duncan, BA, MD, MHA](https://providers.nortonhealthcare.com/provider/Scott+D+Duncan/464915)</span> etc. I was involved in analyzing the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit(NICU) data of hospitals in the State of Kentucky. I also collaborated with antibiotic medicine usage studies by the researchers of <span style ="color:blue">[Kentucky Antibiotic Awareness](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/pediatrics/research/cahrds/KYAbxAwareness)</span> and analyzed recent substantially large pediatric MEDICAID datasets.
