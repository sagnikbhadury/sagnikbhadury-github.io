I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow**  in the <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span> ,  <span style = "color:blue">[Michigan Medicine](https://www.uofmhealth.org/)</span>, <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/)</span>, being mentored by <span style ="color:blue">[Arvind Rao, PhD](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/rao-arvind.html)</span>.

My research, from a Bayesian perspective, has revolved around Directed and Undirected Graphs, High-Dimensional Graphical Models, Sparse Network Estimation and Hierarchical Models, with the use of Regularization and Shrinkage Priors. I am accuring an interest in Spatial Statistics, Variational Bayes Algorithms, and Computational Statistics, particularly in the context of Biostatistics. My interest on the application standpoint lies in Gene Networks, Cancer Biology, Genomics, Single Cell Seq Data, Spatial Transcriptomics, and Image Informatics.

I earned _Ph.D._ in _Biostatistics_ under the watchful eye of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span>, from <span style ="color:blue">[University of Louisville; Louisville, KY, USA](https://louisville.edu/)</span> in Fall 2022. My thesis was focussed on development of more accurate methods for high dimensional bayesian network estimation and heterogeneous joint network estimation through neighborhood selection with multiple breast cancer applications. Prior to my graduation, I won the Doctoral Dissertation Completion Award from the Graduate School of University of Louisville.
