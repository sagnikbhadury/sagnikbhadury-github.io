Thanks for visiting my online platform for self-promotion!

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher**  in the <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span>,  <span style = "color:blue">[Michigan Medicine](https://www.uofmhealth.org/)</span>, <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan, MI, USA](https://umich.edu/)</span>, being mentored by <span style ="color:blue">[Arvind Rao](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/rao-arvind.html)</span>, where I create innovative techniques, computational algorithms, and softwares for extensive genomic and epigenomic data examination, derived from biomedical imaging within Cancer Systems Biology, aiding Precision Medicine. I earned _Ph.D._ in _Biostatistics_ under <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span>, from <span style ="color:blue">[University of Louisville; KY, USA](https://louisville.edu/)</span> in Fall 2022. In recognition of my doctoral research progress, the Grad School of UofL honored me with the Doctoral Dissertation Completion Award.

My research portfolio is anchored in Bayesian frameworks, addressing methods for Undirected Graph construction, High-Dim Graphical Models, as well as practical methodologies for Sparse Network Estimation and Bayesian Variable Selection within Hierarchical Models. I've been trying to broaden my expertise by venturing into the realms of Spatial Statistics, and Variational Bayes Algorithms for scalable statistical analysis in biomedical imaging. 
<!---This development signifies my commitment to incorporate innovative computational methods for complex data in a field that demands precision and efficiency.--->

Application wise, I focus on advanced biostatistical methods for cancer research through next-gen sequencing and biomedical imaging techs like Spatial Transcriptomics (ST), Spatial Multiplex-Immunoprofiling (mIF) and Magnetic resonance imaging.
