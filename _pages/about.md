I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow**  in the <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span> ,  <span style = "color:blue">[Michigan Medicine](https://www.uofmhealth.org/)</span>, <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan, MI, USA](https://umich.edu/)</span>, being mentored by <span style ="color:blue">[Arvind Rao, PhD](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/rao-arvind.html)</span>, where I use my expertise in Graphical Models, Bayesian Methods, Network Inference and Machine Learning in developing novel algorithms and tools to analyze large genomic and epigenomic data arising from biomedical imaging while addressing complex biomedical problems. I earned _Ph.D._ in _Biostatistics_ under the watchful eye of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span>, from <span style ="color:blue">[University of Louisville; Louisville, KY, USA](https://louisville.edu/)</span> in Fall 2022. In recognition of my doctoral research progress, the UofL - Graduate School honored me with the Doctoral Dissertation Completion Award.

My research portfolio is anchored in a Bayesian framework, addressing Undirected Graphs, High-Dimensional Graphical Models, as well as practical methodologies for Sparse Network Estimation and Bayesian Variable Selection within Hierarchical Models. Recently, I've broadened my expertise by venturing into the realms of Spatial Statistics, and Variational Bayes Algorithms for scalable statistical analysis in biomedical imaging. This development signifies my commitment to incorporating innovative computational methods to handle complex data in a field that demands precision and efficiency.

Application wise, I focus on advanced biostatistical methods for cancer research through sequencing data and integrative biomedical imaging technologies like Spatial Transcriptomics (ST), and Spatial Multiplex-Immunoprofiling (mIF). My current aim is to develop methods and analytical tools for Spatial Cancer Systems Biology aiding Precision Medicine.
