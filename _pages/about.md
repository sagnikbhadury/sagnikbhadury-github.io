I am currently a **Rackham Postdoctoral Research Fellow**  of <span style = "color:blue">[University of Michigan Medical School](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics)</span>, working in the _Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics_ working with <span style ="color:blue">[Systems Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sibl.lab.medicine.umich.edu/)</span>. 
 
I got my PhD in Biostatistics from the _Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics_ of <span style = "color:blue">[School of Public Health, University of Louisville (UofL)](https://louisville.edu/sphis)</span>. My PhD research was pursued under the supervision of <span style ="color:blue">[Jeremy Gaskins, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/jeremy-gaskins-phd)</span> and <span style ="color:blue">[Riten Mitra, PhD](https://louisville.edu/sphis/directory/riten-mitra)</span> which was primarily focused on Bayesian Graphical Models in Higher Dimensions, Undirected Graphs, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, Bayesian Hierarchical Models, Shrinkage Priors, Bayesian Variable Selection, and High Dimensional Covariance Estimation. Apart from these I am interested in Computational Statistics, Queuing Theory, Survival Analysis and Longitudinal Data Analysis. 
  
During my PhD I worked as an RA on multiple projects in collaboration with different departments of the <span style ="color:blue">[School of Medicine, UofL](https://louisville.edu/medicine)</span> collaborating with <span style ="color:blue">[Department of Radiation Oncology, UofL](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/radiationoncology)</span>,  <span style ="color:blue">[Department of Pediatrics, UofL](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/pediatrics)</span>. I also collaborated with <span style ="color:blue">[Kentucky Antibiotic Awareness](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/pediatrics/research/cahrds/KYAbxAwareness)</span>. I won the Graduate School Dissertation Completion Award in Aug 2022 and finished as a Graduate School Fellow of UofL.
